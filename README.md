Chimie
======

A project to simulate some chemical reactions

The software was a school project at first, and needs translation, 
and refactoring (There is a lot of French inside the code, including
variable names, etc...).
Its primary usage is to show the influence of the Qr (Reaction Quotient) on 
Chemical Kinetics.

The name will probably change in the future, it is mostly a placeholder for now.

If you would like any change to the program, just let me know (you can open an 
issue on github).
